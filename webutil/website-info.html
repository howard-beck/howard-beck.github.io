        <h2>Basic information</h2>
        This website is intentionally designed to load quickly and not take up resources.
        As such, I am only loading in my own simple scripts, along with CSS.
        I wanted it to almost look like a LaTeX document, so most pages use
            <a href="https://latex.vercel.app">latex.vercel.app</a> to accomplish this.
        Further, I refuse to use MathJax, so I have also loaded in HTML-compatible versions of
            typical AMS fonts, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Firestar-Reimu/AMSFonts-OTF/tree/main">here</a>.
        No amount of my website was developed in any part using generative AI.
        Along similar lines, I do not want such systems to be trained on anything in this website --
            I am using a robots.txt from <a href="https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt">here</a>
            as a first line of defense.
        
        <h2>MIT.edu address</h2>
        As I have now graduated from MIT, my former website <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~hbeck">https://www.mit.edu/~hbeck</a>
            redirects here.
        
        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        My <a href="./">home page</a> will load in iFrames from external parties to count the number
            of visitors to my page over time, from <a href="https://www.digits.net">digits.net</a>, and to
            accumulate country flags of the visitors, from <a href="https://flagcounter.com/">flagcounter.com</a>.
        These do not rely on cookies.
        Please note that these presumably collect some data on their end.
        In particular, I (and you)  are able to get more detailed information about the breakdown.
        This includes information about when the latest visit was from each country.
        Further, there are breakdowns by state in the USA and Canada.

        This website does not currently use cookies.
        
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        If you have difficulty getting information from my website due to digital accessibility problems, do not hesitate to contact me with whatever methods
            I have listed in my <a href="./">home page</a>.
        
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        This website freely assumes you have JavaScript enabled, although it is not used extensively.
        The main uses right now are to make my life easier by standardizing some things across various pages, so
            that I do not have to copy and paste code and make sure all the pages adhere to the same template.
        It is also useful to redirect some links, i.e. if I want to be able to access a page from a shorter url
            than would be dictated by how I want the file system organized.
        
        <br /><br />

        If you have JavaScript disabled, you may notice a warning at the bottom of some of the pages.
        This warning is automatically deleted by a JavaScript function, that is of course only executed if JavaScript is enabled.
        If you are not sure, a similar process has determined that you have JavaScript <i id="js-status">disabled</i>.

        <br /><br />

        There is not a specific version of JavaScript that I am assuming users' browsers have.
        However, I am not doing anything particular high-tech.

        <script>
            document.getElementById("js-status").innerHTML = "enabled"
        </script>
    </body>
