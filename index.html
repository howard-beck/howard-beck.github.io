                                This is an expository paper introducing stable homotopy theory.
                                The ideal readership has taken an introduction to topology course, and is familiar with the language
                                of groups, and ideally (no pun intended) also rings, and modules.
                                It was submitted to a certain unnamed-for-now journal - we'll see what happens!

                                This is intended to get someone with only basic knowledge of (chromatic, stable) homotopy theory
                                up to speed to understand Conjecture 9.9 of Burkland, Schlank, and Yuan
                                (see: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09929">

                                In its current state, this document is mostly complete but will be revised.
                                The first section covers the basics of Bousfield localization, introduces Morava
                                <math>K</math><mathnotit>(</mathnotit><math>n</math><mathnotit>)</mathnotit>-theories and the telescope spectra
                                <math>T</math><mathnotit>(</mathnotit><math>n</math><mathnotit>)</mathnotit>, and
                                of course briefly mentions the (recently disproved) Telescope Conjecture of Ravenel.
                                The second section covers the basics of equivariant spaces, and then develops
                                stable equivariant homotopy theory. By the end, I introduce the geometric fixed point functors
                                on genuine <math>G</math>-spectra which puts the reader (hopefully) in a position to
                                understand the statement of the Chromatic Blueshift Conjecture.

                                The class is unusually not being offered this year, so the reading group is "replacing" the class.

                                This project was done in the second half of my senior year of high school for my AP Research Class.
                                The idea was that modern spacecraft may be able to perform descent using cameras, and there's a desire to
                                outfit their computer systems with hardware capable of calling deep learning models.
                                A statistically robust way to combine image data into the pose estimation algorithm is very
                                computationally expensive, and this paper offers a way to replace this with a recurrent
                                neural network.
                                Frankly, the method I employed is still terribly inefficient and more classical methods that may be
                                less Bayes-optimal are better-suited.
                                However, I'm still begrudgingly making this document publicly accessible for the sake of open
                                research.
                                For a brief while back then and even at the start of my undergrad at MIT, I was considering
                                being some flavor of engineer - here is the evidence of such a time.
                                The code can theoretically be found
                                <a href="https://github.com/howard-beck/RNNs-for-Bayesian-State-Estimation">here</a>,
                                but beware I have absolutely no idea where any of the neural network code is.
                                I fear it is a mystery lost to time.

                                Before I get angry emails from higher algebraists: sometimes I too use the tensor product notation
                                for smash products of spectra!
