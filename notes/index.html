                    My talk covered sections 6-8 of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3724">Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel paper</a>
                    about the Kervaire invariant one problem.

                    <b>Note: </b> These notes are undergoing historical revisionism.
                    They have some small errors and places deserving more clarification.
                    Also, two sections are missing since they were handwritten... that'll be fixed.

                    These are notes from presentations I gave for the 18.906 (Algebraic Topology II) reading group in Fall 2024 at MIT.
                    The class is unusually not being offered this year, so the reading group is "replacing" the class.
                    It's based on Professor <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/">Haynes Miller</a>'s
                    lecture notes, available on
                    <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/course-notes.html">his website</a>.
                    I would like to thank Professor Miller for his contributions to these notes, by pointing out mistakes and giving
                    insightful comments during the presentation that were included in the notes afterwards.
                    My other presentations used written notes that are... somewhere.

                    This project was done in the second half of my senior year of high school for my AP Research Class.
                    The idea was that modern spacecraft may be able to perform descent using cameras, and there's a desire to
                    outfit their computer systems with hardware capable of calling deep learning models.
                    A statistically robust way to combine image data into the pose estimation algorithm is very
                    computationally expensive, and this paper offers a way to replace this with a recurrent
                    neural network.
                    Frankly, the method I employed is still terribly inefficient and more classical methods that may be
                    less Bayes-optimal are better-suited.
                    However, I'm still begrudgingly making this document publicly accessible for the sake of open
                    research.
                    For a brief while back then and even at the start of my undergrad at MIT, I was considering
                    being some flavor of engineer - here is the evidence of such a time.
                    The code can theoretically be found
                    <a href="https://github.com/howard-beck/RNNs-for-Bayesian-State-Estimation">here</a>,
                    but beware I have absolutely no idea where any of the neural network code is.
                    I fear it is a mystery lost to time.
